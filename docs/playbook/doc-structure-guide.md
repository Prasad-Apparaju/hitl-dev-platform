# Documentation Structure Guide

How to organize your project's `docs/` folder. This structure scales from a solo developer to a full product team.

## What Goes Where

| Content | Location | Who owns it |
|---|---|---|
| Product vision, requirements, personas | `01-product/` | PM |
| Architecture diagrams, component design | `02-design/technical/hld/` | Architect |
| Method signatures, class diagrams, sequence diagrams | `02-design/technical/lld/` | Architect |
| Why we chose X over Y | `02-design/technical/adrs/` | Architect (technical advisor approves) |
| Coding standards, testing strategy | `03-engineering/` | Architect |
| Training plans for new patterns | `03-engineering/training/` | Developer who built it |
| Deployment, runbooks, monitoring | `04-operations/` | Architect (owns IaC/Ops) |
| Past incidents + lessons | `04-operations/incident-registry.yaml` | Whoever fixed it |
| Test coverage index | `03-engineering/testing/test-registry.yaml` | Developers |
| Time-bounded project docs (migrations, launches) | `05-<project-specific>/` | Architect — archive after completion |
| Team structure, roles, and role playbooks | `06-team/` | Architect + PM |
| System-wide process guides (feature workflow, fix workflow) | `playbook/` | Shared |

---

## Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Numbered folders | `NN-name/` for the core hierarchy | `01-product/`, `02-design/` |
| Unnumbered folders | For cross-cutting concerns | `playbook/`, `patterns/`, `releases/` |
| HLD files | One per system area | `system.md`, `data.md`, `security.md` |
| LLD files | Organized by layer | `controllers/auth.md`, `services/model-router.md` |
| ADRs | Descriptive names | `idempotency-keys.md`, `retry-policy.md` |
| Templates | Always in `/shared/templates/` at repo root | Not in `docs/` |

## Getting Started

1. Copy this structure into your project's `docs/` folder
2. Start with `01-product/prd.md` (use `shared/templates/prd-template.md`)
3. Create `docs/system-manifest.yaml` (use `shared/templates/system-manifest-template.yaml`)
4. Add `docs/README.md` as the navigation index
5. Fill in docs as you design and build — the 31-step process drives doc creation

The numbered folders represent a logical progression: understand the product (01) → design the solution (02) → build it (03) → run it (04). Not every project needs all folders on day one.
